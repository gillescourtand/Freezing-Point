 <div align="justify">Behavioral analysis based on video recording has become the norm in neuroscience research. However, the automatic and accurate extraction of freezing sequences remains a bottleneck for many researchers using the fear conditioning protocol. Most of the available software either have numerous parameters that are unclear and difficult for users to evaluate, or an analysis method that depends on the equipment used for data acquisition and is not sufficiently adaptable to the various experimental conditions that exist.</br>
Freezing-Point facilitates the transparency and accessibility of video analysis and offers a highly automated solution with interactive visualization tools that allow users to intuitively adjust settings to match what they observe. The software is simple and user-friendly enough that it does not require extensive training or reading complex documentation.</br> 
 </br>  
What's more, FreezingPoint has been validated to reliably and robustly extract freezing events in fear conditionning experiments that can handle several datas as input, videos or tracks files produced by markerless pose estimation software as DeepLabCut or SLEAP, across different protocole, and from video with different quality. In practice, FreezingPoint provides an open-source freezing analysis software with user-friendly interactive visualizations to explore parameters and validate results to keep the user close to his data.</div>
