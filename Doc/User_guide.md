## Pixel analysis from videos
To start using your videos, simply drag and drop your files :

![freezingPointv1_drag_videos_edit](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84ef5256-5f62-41b7-9e24-1b27727489ee)

You may need to exclude part of the scene (timestamp, area outside the experimental setup) : adjust the green rectangle to the region of interest :

![freezingPointv1_video_crop](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1e013a9-834d-45c7-8c5e-ddf9451d0aab)

Know you can launch the analysis with the "PROCESS" button
